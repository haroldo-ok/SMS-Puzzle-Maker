A super-basic JavaScript map editor for HTML5 games.

Based on Nikki's TinyMapEditor: https://github.com/nikki/TinyMapEditor

Improvements over the original:

- Can customize the tile size;
- Can adjust zoom level;
- Can upload a custom tileset;
- Persists the map on the browser's local storage, so that it will be left the way the user left, when returning to the app;
- Export the entire project to JSON.

TODO:

- Implement multiple maps;
- Implement support for custom metadata.
